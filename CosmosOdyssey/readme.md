The idea was at first to complete use .NET to build both FE and BE but after realising that .NET uses someting Razor pages of what I have not heard of.
It was thus desided that BE will be made usid .NET and microsoft server manager, and the FE using HTML, CSS and javascript.

First I needed to reinstall Microsoft visual studio as I had not too long ago done a factory reset to my laptop, and same with microsoft server manager.
Getting those to work was fairly simple and connecting the Visual Studio to the Server (my laptop) was also relatiovly simple.

Then I made a plan on how to mnanage the data for the project and came up with the following solutoion.

The biggest hurdle has been the building of the database using .NET following multiple guides and stack overflows I kept getting the error build failed.

After many attempts and hours I desided to make the FE first. The design was simple but somewhat elegant. Adleast Id like to think so myself. But the 
main idea was to have it be nice looking on all devices wiht all kinds of resolutions. After I felt satisfied I went back to BE to try to figure out 
what is wrong and why I can not build the database using .NET
