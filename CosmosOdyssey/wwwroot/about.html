        <p>When applying for a job, candidates are often assigned tasks to
            help the employer assess their skills and suitability for the
            position. I was tasked with creating a website using .NET. My
            approach involved developing the backend with .NET and
            integrating it with a frontend built using standard HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript.
